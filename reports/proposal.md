# Network Programming in C

### Vedaant Kuchhal and Charlie Babe

## Previous Project
**Charlie:** My experience in my previous project was that I should have managed lead times better, I should have ordered parts from the very beginning, to have enough time to iterate on my project since when the parts did arrive they did not work. For this project I want from the very beginning to look ahead at the possible paths the project can take and order anything that we know we might use, to avoid getting parts too late.

**Vedaant:** My previous project went pretty well overall! We achieved our learning goals, did not over-scope, and had a non-stressful time overall. I just wish that we had been more consistent with the effort we put in, since it did feel like it was all a bit last-minute. We also followed a tutorial really closely and I feel that I didn’t gain as much experience in C programming as I would have liked to, and in this project I hope to be more hands-on in trying things by myself and gaining experience.

## Goals of Current Project
Gain experience in network programming in C. We will build a chat interface to allow users to communicate over the network. Our lower bound would be to implement basic socket programming in C, while a stretch goal would be implementing a peer-to-peer chat interface over Bluetooth or WiFi without the need for a server. A *stretch* stretch goal would be to implement the functionality of the iOS feature ‘Airdrop` in C.

## Our Learning Goals
**Vedaant:** My main goal is to learn how network communications work not only in the ‘hard’ coding sense, but also in a general systems/process sense so that I can quickly grasp how to do implementations in other languages and contexts. In addition, I want to build a project that has more ‘real world’ interactiveness. My previous project was a Shell, and while I enjoyed it and learned a lot, this project I want to gear myself more towards a project that has more polished applications. 
**Charlie:** My primary goal is to learn more about network communication protocols, and learn about how wireless transmission protocols like WiFi and Bluetooth work. I also want to learn more about the security of wireless transmission protocols and how trust is established in a world where wireless transmissions can be sniffed. In addition, I want to build a project that I could potentially see having real world impact because I feel more motivated by working on novel problems and solutions since I am actually contributing something to the world.


## What we Need to get Started
Some sort of resources/tutorials about how to implement sockets and network programming in C. We hope to gain a solid understanding of the sockets and communication protocols we will be using before implementing our network communication. In order to do this, we can probably ask other teams that worked with socket programming in C for any resources that they found helpful. As our project goals and scope grow and develop, we will find more appropriate resources online or by consulting the CAs/Steve as necessary.

## First Steps
1. Find online tutorials about how to do network programming in C. A few resources, such as [this one](https://csperkins.org/teaching/2009-2010/networked-systems/lab04.pdf), seem promising.
2. Start to build an understanding of how this works and can be manipulated. We’ll probably try to draw a few diagrams as we learn more.
3. Look into other libraries, such as [C’s Bluetooth library](https://people.csail.mit.edu/albert/bluez-intro/c404.html) to help supplement our understanding of how to use this protocol.
